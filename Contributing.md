Before embarking on any major effort, it's a good idea to discuss what you'd like to do on the [Gitter](https://gitter.im/autokey/autokey) platform to make sure it has a good chance of being accepted and to draw on our experience as to the best way to proceed.

## Contributing code

Autokey is currently undergoing large changes on its `develop` branch. If you are writing code for anything other than small bugfixes, you should base off that branch. It is very far ahead of `master`, and has tidier code.

`develop` is the only branch with a working test framework, which you should do your best to use for code you contribute. Currently test coverage is very low, but that should not be an excuse for making it worse---please include tests for your code. Feel free to ask for help with writing tests in your PR comments.

Finally, please read [CONTRIBUTERS.rst](https://github.com/autokey/autokey/blob/develop/CONTRIBUTORS.rst) on that same branch.
