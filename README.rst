About
=====
`AutoKey`_, a desktop automation utility for Linux and X11, formerly hosted on `Google`_, has been updated to run on Python 3.

**Important**: This is an X11 application and, as such, will not function correctly when Wayland is in use instead of Xorg.

**What is AutoKey?**
AutoKey is a powerful Linux desktop automation tool for `X11`` that allows users to:
- Automate repetitive text entries using abbreviations.
- Trigger scripts and macros with hotkeys.
- Control application windows via Python scripting.
- Streamline workflows across multiple programs.

With AutoKey, you can save time and reduce repetitive strain by automating text, keyboard, and mouse inputs across any application.

Bug reports
===========
Bug reports are welcome. Please use the `GitHub Issue Tracker`_ to report bugs. When reporting a suspected bug, please make sure to include as much information as possible to expedite troubleshooting and resolution.

Here are some possible examples of the types of information you might need to provide:

* Details on how to reproduce the issue you are experiencing are always helpful.
* An `AutoKey error message`_ is helpful when something is wrong with your AutoKey script.
* An `AutoKey traceback`_ is helpful when AutoKey runs without crashing, a trigger was used, and the expected event either didn't occur or something other than the expected result occurred.
* A `Python traceback`_ is helpful when something is wrong with your AutoKey script, causing an exception to be shown in your AutoKey error message.

If you're not sure your issue is a bug or you'd like help with reporting it, you can post about it first on one of the `platforms used by our community`_ and we'll assist you.
