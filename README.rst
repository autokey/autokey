About
=====
`AutoKey`_, a desktop automation utility for Linux and X11, formerly hosted at `OldAutoKey`_. Updated to run on Python 3. 

**Important**: This is an X11 application, and as such will not function 100% on distributions that default to using Wayland instead of Xorg.

.. _OldAutoKey: https://code.google.com/archive/p/autokey/

Installation
============

**Please remove previous installations of both AutoKey and AutoKey-py3 fully before installing!**

For detailed installation instructions, please visit the `Installation`_ page. in our wiki.

.. _Installation: https://github.com/autokey/autokey/wiki/Installing

Zero-installation Method
++++++++++++++++++++++++

AutoKey can also be used directly from the cloned repository. This is useful, e.g., for trying
out a new version without removing a current installation.

1. Start the Autokey daemon

.. code:: sh

   cd lib
   python3 -m autokey.gtkui
   # or for KDE
   python3 -m autokey.qtui

2. Start the Autokey UI (if desired) by appending the --configure or -c command line switch to the end of the command.

The commands accept CLI switches just like the regular installation, so
:code:`python3 -m autokey.qtui -lc` works as expected.
