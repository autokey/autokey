Above all, I wish to thank my wife Margaret Tam.  You're always there
when I need you.  You're always there to support me throughout the
good and bad in life.  I love you my dear.

I'd like to thank Eddie Bell for his keylogger example.  It was the
turning point in my early development of the program that gave me what
I needed for monitoring keyboard input.

I'd especially like to thank Peter Liljenberg for writing the
python-xlib extension, without which this software wouldn't have been
possible.

I'd like to acknowledge Textpander, Texter and the Autohotkey
developers whose software was an inspiration to this software.

I'd like to thank all of the people on the Ubuntu forums who have
given me their feedback and/or tried the program (in no particular
order or preference): Vadi, Scarath, jackocleebrown, ugm6hr,
RebounD11, Bungo Pony, forrestcupp, kevdog, conehead77,
PartisanEntity, DjBones, antisocialist, Specter043, Linuxratty,
SanskritFritz, Martje_001, tribaal, Vitamin-Carrot.

I'd like to thank SourceForge for hosting the project.

Lastly I'd like to thank Guido van Rossum for authoring the Python
programming language, and RMS for gcc and GNU Emacs.
