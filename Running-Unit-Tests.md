Running the unit tests
======================

The unit test suite has two additional requirements:

*  [Pytest](https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest) - [PyPi](https://pypi.org/project/pytest/)
*  [PyHamcrest](https://github.com/hamcrest/PyHamcrest/) - [PyPi](https://pypi.org/project/PyHamcrest/)

Running the test suite is integrated into `setup.py`. The tests can be run by executing `python3 setup.py test` from the repository root directory.
