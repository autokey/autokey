## What are Discussions
The **Discussions** section of the AutoKey project can be found in the menu at the top of any AutoKey page. It's a place where GitHub users can create and participate in discussions. Although these typically tend to be used by developers, anyone can participate. An advantage of discussions is that GitHub will automatically create links to other GitHub pages when they're mentioned.
