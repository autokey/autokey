In a nutshell, Autokey is a little GUI to run Python-3 scripts, specially focussing on MACRO and keypress functionality. 

AutoKey is not meant to be used as a general Python IDE, so it lacks debugger support and a lot more.
If you wish, you can use your favourite Python IDE to edit your AutoKey scripts.
