## Create dynamic phrases by using macros as placeholders
Phrases can be made dynamic by including one or more macros. A macro looks like an XML/HTML `<tag>`, it consists of a special keyword and space separated arguments in the `key=value` form, enclosed in angle brackets (`<` and `>`). Whenever a Phrase is expanded, all included macros are executed. Then the macro tags are replaced with their execution results. When the replacement is finished, the result gets pasted or typed (depending on the phrase setting).

In versions older than `0.96.0`, the interface and implementation is a bit brittle:
- Argument values can’t contain spaces
- `<>` angle brackets in argument values interfere with the parser, and can’t be escaped

In `0.96.0`, arguments can be quoted if they contain spaces, and angle brackets can be escaped with a single `\`. Only `\` before an angle bracket counts as an escape character. To form a literal `\>`, just add a single extra slash before the `\>`. To add a literal `\` anywhere else, just add as normal for a string.

Macros cannot have a `\` right before the final `>`. If you need this, quote the argument containing the `\`, or add a space after it.

Example of a quoted and escaped macro: `<script name=system args="xclip \> ~/sorted_clip.txt">`

Other notes:

- All arguments are required for a particular macro type, even if you don’t want to use them (like providing arguments to executed scripts)
- Macros cannot be nested within one another (e.g., a `date` macro cannot use a `file` macro to provide the format).


## Available macros
Currently, there are four macros available:
* `Position cursor`: `<cursor>` positions the text cursor at the indicated text position. There may be only one `<cursor>` macro in a phrase, either directly or indirectly.
* `Insert date`: `<date>` inserts the current date. The format parameter takes a formatting string, allowing precise control over the resulting string.
* `Insert file contents`: `<file>` takes a file name as a parameter and reads the file content from the disk. Beware that the whole content is read into the system memory at once and is then typed or pasted. Don’t use it with too large files, or experience application- or system lock-ups or long expansion times.
* `Run script`: `<script>`executes any AutoKey script. Scripts executed from Phrases should never use the `keyboard` directly, instead return their replacement text using the `engine.set_return_value(str)`function.
* (As of `0.96.0`) `Run system command`: `<system>` takes a string as a parameter and replaces the macro with stdout of that string run as a system command.

Macro templates are available and can be inserted into a currently edited phrase using the menu bar:
* Qt GUI: `Tools` menu → `Insert Macro` → Choose one from the list
* GTK GUI: `Edit` menu → `Insert Macro` → Choose one from the list

### Position cursor
The `<cursor>` macro does not take any extra arguments. When present in a phrase, the text cursor will be placed at the position indicated by the macro position.
The example phrase with content `my<cursor> phrase` will be expanded to `my| phrase`, where `|` indicates the text cursor position.
Because there is only one text cursor in the currently active text editor, there can be only one `<cursor>` macro in the phrase. Trying to use more than one `<cursor>` macro in a single phrase will result in a wrongly positioned cursor.

### Insert date
The `<date format=formatting_string>` macro is replaced with the current date. The format string is evaluated by the Python3 `datetime.datetime.strftime()` function, thus must be a valid Python date formatting string. The exact and up to date documentation for the supported format codes can be found [here](https://docs.python.org/3/library/datetime.html#strftime-strptime-behavior). The supported format codes may depend on the Python version used to run AutoKey. The Python API is stable, but new format codes might get available, as new Python versions get released.

### Insert file contents
The `<file name=path_to_file>` reads a file from disk and inserts the file content into the phrase. The `name`  parameter takes an absolute file path.
The full file content is read into the system memory and then placed into the phrase, so restrict yourself to small text files. When using a 1MB large file, autokey will need about one million key strokes to type the content. Typically, text editors dislike raw binary data, so only use text files.

This can be used to include another Phrase by specifying its full file path and treating it like an ordinary file.

### Run script
The `<script name=script_name args=comma_separated_argument_string>` macro allows to use AutoKey Python scripts for Phrase content generation.
This macro will execute the specified script during the macro processing step, before the phrase is pasted.
The `<script>` macro token will be replaced with the script return value, which can be set using the `engine.set_return_value(str)` function. You should set the return value to a Python `str` string only.
If there is an error, the macro will be replaced with that instead.

As of `0.96.0`, Scripts outside of autokey can be executed by passing their absolute path (including `~`, which is expanded to `$HOME`) to `name=` instead of a description.

Currently, the `args` argument expects a string containing comma separated values (CSV).
The data is split at the `,` signs and is available as a list containing strings using the `engine.get_macro_arguments()` function.
If there is no comma in the input data, the resulting list will contain a single item.
Currently, the `args` argument is required. So if you don’t need it, just feed in some dummy value.
This behavior might be improved in the future.

Running a Script using the `script` macro poses some limitations:
- The `keyboard` built-in cannot be used. It is available and can in theory be used to type, but actually using it _will_ break the Phrase processing.
  - Because all scripts are executed even _before_ the trigger abbreviation is removed and the whole phrase is pasted/typed in one go, scripts can’t be used to type _anywhere_ in the phrase text.
- Simple rule: Do nothing that alters the current system GUI state.
  - Do not use `keyboard` to type/send keys.
  - Do not use `mouse` to do mouse clicks anywhere.
  - Do not use `system.exec_command` to execute GUI manipulation/automation tools, like `xdotool`.

You may use the script to alter background system state, like starting or stopping system services, but simply restricting yourself to reading data in will yield the best results.

### Run system command
As of `0.96.0`: `<system command='echo test'>` is replaced in the phrase with the output of `echo test` - i.e., test.
