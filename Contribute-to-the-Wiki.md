## Introduction ##
Anyone with a [GitHub](https://github.com/) account is welcome to contribute to the [AutoKey wiki](https://github.com/autokey/autokey/wiki). A GUI editor is provided and the [Markdown format](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/writing-on-github/getting-started-with-writing-and-formatting-on-github/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax) is used to format the text. Some common wiki-editing procedures are below.
