## Introduction ##
Anyone with a [GitHub](https://github.com/) account is welcome to contribute to the [AutoKey wiki](https://github.com/autokey/autokey/wiki). A GUI editor is provided and the [Markdown format](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/writing-on-github/getting-started-with-writing-and-formatting-on-github/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax) is used to format the text. Some common wiki-editing procedures are below.

## Create a page ##
1. Log in to [GitHub](https://github.com/).
2. Visit the [main wiki URL](https://github.com/autokey/autokey/wiki).
3. Check the **Table of Contents** on the right side to see if the page you want to create already exists.
4 If it does, edit that page. Otherwise, click the **"New page"** button in the upper right corner of the page (note that this button is available on all the wiki pages).
5. Type a title into the **"Title"** text-box at the top of the page.
6. Create your page in the editing pane.
7. Left-click the **"Preview"** tab at any time to see how your changes will look, and left-click the **"Write"** tab to return to the editing pane.
8. When you're satisfied with your change(s), write an **"Edit message"** in the little text-box beneath the editing pane.
9. Click the **"Save page"** button.
10. Copy the link of the page from the URL bar of the browser.
11. Edit the **Table of Contents** on the main wiki page and add the new page's name and URL to the appropriate section of the listing by using the same format as the existing listed	entries.
12. Put an announcement about the new page into [the AutoKey Gitter chat room](https://gitter.im/autokey/autokey) so that others can find it.

## Edit a page ##

3. Click the **"Edit"** button in the top right corner of the page.
4. Select all of the contents in the editing pane and save them to a text file as a backup and/or reference to use while you're working.
5. Make the change(s) to the page, either by using the same format as the content that's already there or by making improvements to it.
6. Left-click the **"Preview"** tab at any time to see how your changes will look, and left-click the **"Write"** tab to return to the editing pane.
7. When you're satisfied with your change(s), write a summary of what you changed in the **"Edit message"** text-box beneath the editing pane using present-tense for the message.

9. Delete or archive the text file you had created in step 4 above.

## Rename a page ##
Before you begin, carefully consider the consequences of changing the name of an existing page. It's possible that doing so will break links to the page. It might also be a good idea to suggest a name change in [the AutoKey Gitter chat room](https://gitter.im/autokey/autokey) first so that others can weigh in on whether or not the change would be welcome as an improvement. 
1. Log in to [GitHub](https://github.com/).
2. Visit the URL of the page you'd like to edit or open the main wiki page and click on the page you'd like to edit in the **Table of Contents**.
3. Click the **"Edit"** button in the top right corner of the page.
4. Change the name of the page in the **"Title"** text-box at the top of the page above the editing pane (note that there's no **"Title"** label for that text-box).
5. When you're satisfied with your change, write a summary of what you changed in the **"Edit message"** text-box beneath the editing pane using present-tense for the message.
6. Left-click the **"Save page"** button.
7. Delete or archive the text file you had created in step 5 above.
8. If you changed the page's name,  follow this up by editing the **Table of Contents** on the main wiki page and replacing the name and link with the new ones.
9. Optional or if the edit is significant (like a name change): Put an announcement about the change(s) into [the AutoKey Gitter chat room](https://gitter.im/autokey/autokey) so that others will know about it.
