## What is Google Groups
Google Groups is a service from Google that provides discussion groups for people sharing common interests. The Groups service also provides a gateway to Usenet newsgroups via a shared user interface. Google Groups became operational in February 2001, following Google's acquisition of Deja's Usenet archive.

## Our Google Group
https://groups.google.com/g/autokey-users?pli=1

When requesting to join the group, also post a message to it. (You can send an email to autokey-users@googlegroups.com.) GG doesn't send any notifications for join requests, so we won't see your request for a long time, but it does send them for posts from non-members.
