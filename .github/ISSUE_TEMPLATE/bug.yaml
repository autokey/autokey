        If someone else has [already filled out a bug report for the
        issue you're having](https://github.com/autokey/autokey/issues),
        consider contributing to that report instead of creating a new
        one. If your issue hasn't been reported yet, check this box and
        continue filling out this form.

        When creating AutoKey issues, whenever you have a question (as opposed to an issue), it's better to post it on our [Google list](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/autokey-users) or in our [Gitter chat](https://gitter.im/autokey/autokey). The list is more user-oriented, whereas more technical questions will get a better answer on Gitter.


        Both of these venues have a number of active users, so you are likely to get more, better, and faster answers on them than in here on GitHub, where only our very busy developers and a few users see the posts. We also prefer to have the developers developing rather than taking time to answer questions and manage issues that the user-community could handle for them.

        - label: This is not a question.

      label: Can you provide the output of the AutoKey command?
      description: >
        This is only needed for some bugs. Sometimes, the output from
        starting AutoKey from a terminal window with either the
        ```autokey-gtk``` or ```autokey-qt``` command provides helpful
        messages that can be pasted below. If those aren't sufficient or
        if your issue involves a crash, throws an exception, or produces
        other unexpected results,
        [running an AutoKey trace](https://github.com/autokey/autokey-python2/wiki/Problem-Reporting-Guide)
        may be helpful. You can do this by running AutoKey from a
        terminal window with the ```autokey-gtk --verbose``` or
        ```autokey-qt --verbose``` command, then recreating your issue,
        then closing AutoKey, and then pasting any messages it produces
        below:
