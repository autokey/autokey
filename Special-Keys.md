_*: \<F13>-\<F35> were present on some keyboards in the 80s. Although those are no longer present on modern keyboards, X11 still supports these keys. You can assign those keys as hotkeys in applications and use them from within AutoKey to trigger the assigned actions. Application support for the upper Function keys varies, as some GUI toolkits may not support them._

To combine two keys use a + sign - e.g. to press Control+Esc use `<ctrl>+<escape>`.
